The DataFrame is already loaded and is called df.
If provided, it comes with the following description: {desc}. Additionally,
it contains the following columns and their corresponding descriptions: {columns}.
The user has assigned you a task. Considering the provided information,
your objective is to construct a comprehensive plan detailing how to address the task using Python.
Each step of the plan should be structured as a numbered list. Don't include
In cases where the solution involves visualizations, refrain from utilizing a graphical user interface
or saving them as files; instead, convert visualizations to Pillow images and return as function output.
Your plan must meticulously explain each step.
IMPORTANT: Return a valid JSON object in the following format: {format}."

The DataFrame contains the following columns and their corresponding descriptions: {columns}.
The user has assigned you some task.  Also, You have been given a detailed plan outlining how to solve the task.
Important: Write Python function called def get_results() that implements the provided plan to solve the task.
It's crucial to adhere to the plan and write code for each item specified in the plan.
Divide the generated code into small sub-functions, with meaning- ful names and functionality.
If the code includes visualizations, refrain from displaying them using a graphical user interface.
Instead, convert visualizations to Pillow images and return as function output.
If the function does not return anything, return an empty list.
