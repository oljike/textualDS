Important: Write Python function called def get_results() that implements the provided plan to solve the task.
It's crucial to adhere to the plan and write code for each item specified in the plan.
Divide the generated code into small sub-functions, with meaningful names and functionality.
If the code includes visualizations, refrain from displaying them using a graphical user interface.
Instead, convert visualizations to Pillow images and return as function output.
If the function does not return anything, return an empty list.
